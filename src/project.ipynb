    "## Part 1. Overview of CART (Classification And Regression Trees)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "CART (Classification And Regression Trees), introduced by Breiman et al. (1984), is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning that constructs binary trees for classification and regression. Unlike algorithms like ID3 or C4.5 which can generate multi-way splits, CART produces strictly binary trees, recursively partitioning the feature space into rectangular regions. This project implements a CART classifier from scratch, designed to mimic the behavior of `sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` to ensure correctness and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is represented as a binary tree $T$.\n",
    "- **Nodes**: partition the data based on a splitting rule $x_j \\leq \\tau$.\n",
    "- **Leaves**: assign a class label based on the majority vote of samples falling into that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an input vector $\\mathbf{x}$, the prediction function $f(\\mathbf{x})$ traverses the tree from root to leaf:\n",
    "$$ f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\text{argmax}_k \\sum_{i \\in R_{leaf(\\mathbf{x})}} \\mathbb{I}(y_i = k) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loss Function: Gini Impurity\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Gini Impurity as the objective function for splitting, which measures the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a node $t$ with class probabilities $p_k$, the Gini impurity is:\n",
    "$$ G(t) = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^K p_k^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of a split $s$ (into left child $t_L$ and right child $t_R$) is measured by the **Gini Gain** (or decrease in impurity):\n",
    "$$ \\Delta G(s, t) = G(t) - \\left( \\frac{N_{t_L}}{N_t} G(t_L) + \\frac{N_{t_R}}{N_t} G(t_R) \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose the split $(j^*, \\tau^*)$ that maximizes $\\Delta G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "One significant advantage of CART is interpretability. We quantify the importance of each feature by summing the weighted Gini impurity decrease for all nodes $t$ where feature $j$ is used for splitting:\n",
    "$$ \\text{Importance}(j) = \\sum_{t \\in T: v(t)=j} \\frac{N_t}{N} \\Delta G(s_t, t) $$\n",
    "where $N$ is the total number of samples. These values are typically normalized to sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training**: Finding the best split requires sorting feature values. For $N$ samples and $D$ features, the cost at the root is $O(D \\cdot N \\log N)$. Since the tree depth is bounded by $O(\\log N)$ (for balanced trees) or $N$ (worst case), the total training complexity is roughly $O(D \\cdot N^2)$ in the worst case, or $O(D \\cdot N \\log^2 N)$ typically.\n",
    "- **Inference**: $O(\\text{depth})$, which is usually $O(\\log N)$. This makes prediction extremely fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizer: Greedy Recursive Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree is built using a greedy approach:\n",
    "1. Start with all data at the root.\n",
    "2. Find the best split $(j, \\tau)$ across all features and thresholds.\n",
    "3. Partition data and recurse.\n",
    "4. Stop when max depth is reached, node is pure, or minimum samples constraint is met.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Interpretability**: Tree structure is easy to visualize and understand\n",
    "2. **Non-parametric**: No assumptions about data distribution\n",

    "4. **Feature interactions**: Automatically captures feature interactions\n",
    "5. **Minimal preprocessing**: No need for feature scaling or normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overfitting**: Tendency to create overly complex trees that don't generalize\n",
    "2. **Instability**: Small changes in data can result in very different trees\n",
    "3. **Bias**: Biased toward features with more levels\n",
    "4. **Local optimum**: Greedy algorithm doesn't guarantee global optimum\n",
    "5. **High variance**: Individual trees have high variance (addressed by ensemble methods)\n",
